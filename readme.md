## Security Considerations

Security is paramount for protecting user data and ensuring the integrity of the LexiAI app. Here are some key security considerations:

- **HTTPS:** Ensure all communication between the app and server uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Authentication:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms like JWT and OAuth2.
- **Data Storage:** Use Ionic Secure Storage or native device secure storage for sensitive data such as authentication tokens.
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Secure Dependencies:** Regularly update dependencies and plugins to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Permissions:** Handle permissions carefully when accessing native device features using Capacitor or Cordova plugins.
